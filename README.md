# Final Project: IS 597 PR
# Analyzing Cryptocurrency data (Bitcoin), and its connection with laws and regulations passed
### Overview
This project investigates the relationship between Bitcoin price fluctuations and the introduction of laws and regulations related to cryptocurrency. By analyzing Bitcoin's historical price data alongside key legal events, the goal is to uncover insights into how legal frameworks influence the cryptocurrency market.

### Datasets Used

## Hypotheses 
## (Ananyaa) Hypothesis 1: Crypto price volatility increases substantially in the days following the implementation of regulatory policies.
Cryptocurrencies are assets that can be influenced by various factors, 
including regulatory interventions. This hypothesis posits that regulatory actions 
introduce uncertainty into the market, resulting in heightened volatility in the days 
following such events. Volatility is assessed using metrics like the standard deviation of 
price changes, daily high-low price ranges, and normalized percentage price changes.

### Analysis and Observations

#### 1. **Volatility Metrics**
- **Overall Average Volatility (2017-2024):**
  - During event periods: **0.1**
  - General periods: **0.101**
- These values indicate minimal differences, suggesting that on a broader timescale, volatility during regulatory event periods does not significantly differ from general market conditions.

#### 2. **Price Range**
- **Average Daily Price Range (2017-2024):**
  - During event periods: **1300.539**
  - General periods: **1092.913**
- This highlights more pronounced price fluctuations within single days during regulatory events, supporting the idea that regulatory announcements create short-term market uncertainty.

#### 3. **Normalized Price Change**
- **Average Normalized Price Change (2017-2024):**
  - During event periods: **0.011**
  - General periods: **0.007**
- This indicates slightly more aggressive price movements during regulatory periods.

#### 4. **Yearly Trends**
- While a yearly comparison of average volatility showed no strong or consistent patterns, other charts demonstrated increases in **percentage price change** 
during regulatory event periods. This suggests localized volatility spikes during certain regulatory events, 
even if they do not significantly impact annual averages.

---

### Conclusion
The data provides partial support for the hypothesis:
- **Daily price ranges** and **percentage price changes** are notably higher during regulatory event periods.
- However, the minimal difference in broader volatility metrics suggests that the hypothesis may need refinement.

#### **Revised Hypothesis**
*"Crypto price fluctuations and short-term volatility increase immediately following the implementation of regulatory policies, though the long-term impact on overall market volatility remains minimal."*

This revision better reflects the observed trends, emphasizing **short-term impacts** while acknowledging the lack of significant long-term effects.


## (Danni) Hypothesis 2: Bill passed in house has more impact on Bitcoin price trends than a bill that has only been introduced.
## (Mengyao) Hypothesis 5: Crypto prices react more to regulations in Q3 and Q4, compared with Q1 and Q2.
The hypothesis is based on the assumption that end-of-year activities, such as profit-taking, or year-end settlements, could lead to higher volumes and price volatility.​

## (Mengyao) Hypothesis 6: Crypto prices react more to regulations than to supportive bills.​
